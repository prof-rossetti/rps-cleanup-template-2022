# rps-cleanup-2022

We created a game of rock-paper-scissors, but does it actually work as desired, and is our code as maintainable as it could be? 

See the [exercise description](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/intro-to-python/blob/main/exercises/rps-cleanup/README.md) for more details and instructions.

## Setup

Create a virtual environment:

```sh
conda create -n rps-env python=3.8
```

Activate the virtual environment:

```sh
conda activate rps-env
```

Install package dependencies (mainly for testing):

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Run the rock paper scissors game:

```sh
python game.py
```
